# Contributing to Virt Blocks

All contributions are welcome! There are a few things that you need
to be aware of before contributing, however: hence this file.

## Basic code quality standards

Before submitting patches, make sure that `make build`, `make test`,
`make run-examples`, `make vet` and `make fmt` still pass with them
applied.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributors are required to be compliant with the [Developer
Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/): by
including a `Signed-off-by` line with your full name and email
address in each commit message, you attests that you've read the
document and are in compliance with it.

Patches lacking a proper `Signed-off-by` line will not be accepted.

## Submitting patches

[GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/virtblocks/virtblocks/pulls)
and [GitLab merge requests](https://gitlab.com/virtblocks/virtblocks/merge_requests)
are both accepted, but the former is preferred because it's hooked
up with CI.
